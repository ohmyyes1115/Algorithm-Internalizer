# Algorithm-Internalizer
This is a learning application designed to help users master algorithm knowledge.

It automatically provides exercises based on learner's familiarity with algorithm concepts.

By incorporating the forgetting curve, learners no longer need to track when and what to review.

They can focus their attention on "internalizing" the material during their review sessions.

## Usage
1. The application displays the exercises that need to be practiced.
2. The learner completes the exercise.
3. The learner provides feedback on their familiarity with the problem.
4. Return to step 1.

## TODO
1. Store data in a database.
1. Integration with LeetCode account.
2. Allow learners to dynamically add problems / topics to the exercising pools.
3. Add an achievement system.
